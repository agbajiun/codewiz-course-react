From simple drag and drop interfaces to developing more complex algorithms, kids can explore the world around them and bring their ideas to life with code. LEGO WeDo enables students to develop computational thinking skills and transform them directly into programming solutions that interact with the real world. Kids will learn to use the motion and tilt sensors. As they advance in the course, they will learn to create simple animations on the computers that they control with their robots.",
